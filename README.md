# Cathay-Hackathon Team-146

- Before running the app, run pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal to install the required dependencies
- Run py -m venv .venv to create a virtual environment to run the program
- Run flask --app trial run to deploy the chatbot
- Run the Cathay Virtual Travel Assistant Chat bot on local ip that we will receive on terminal
- Then we can ask for anything to our virtual assistant and it will give us an answer
- When we ask for locations inside any airport, it will redirect us to Cathay World which is a digital world for passangers to explore and navigate through airports.
